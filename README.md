# Sprint 4 Project: Car Analysis
For this project I have 2 main files: app.py and EDA.ipynb
In project I used pandas, streamlit and plotly express to genrate a website with 2 check boxes, which staisfy the conditions shown on the graph such as when, I used the dataframes of cars to determine how odometer affects car pricing. The higher the mileage the more likley the price drops on a car. I also determined that other coulmns such as year, condition and 4wd affected the price of the car.
